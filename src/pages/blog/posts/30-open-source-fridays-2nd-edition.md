On the second edition of the Open Source Fridays, here's what we've done:

* I opened a pull request for a project called [`m`](https://github.com/qrush/m) that makes it easier to run `Test::Unit` and `Minitest` tests. Here's a [link](https://github.com/unmanbearpig/m/pull/1).
* Miguel was working hard on WebRTC, a great technology that is yet maturing and thus needs a lot of love. The net result was [1 pull request](https://github.com/goinstant/webrtc/pull/14), [1 issue](https://github.com/goinstant/webrtc/issues/15) and a [demo page](https://naps62.github.io/webrtc-tests/).
* Gabriel helped out the guys at HabitRPG by integrating it with `grunt-phonegap`. Here's the [pull request](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg-mobile/pull/186).
* João and Roberto were ultimating the details for the launch of a super secret project that we'll unveil later this week. This is a good one. ;)
* Gabriel and Roberto were also rewriting the docs and fixing some scripts on [the Shelf](https://github.com/groupbuddies/theshelf), our company library manager, in order to make it more user friendly. Go check it out, it's 100% open source.

We're contemplating the possibility of releasing this as a newsletter instead of a weekly post. What do you think?
