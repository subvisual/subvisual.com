There's just one thing I need to be ok: alone time. Being by myself is how I recharge and find the motivation to keep going. Knowing this, just imagine how sweet it sounded when I was invited to go to the UK to work with a client at his office. It happened last week, and it was music to my ears.

I was pretty excited about the idea of traveling alone for the first time, but I do tend to worry about the unknown, so I triple checked everything: every item in the bag; the bag size; the time of the flight; the train routes; the Airbnb address. I used Street View to try to understand how safe the neighborhood was. I download every information I needed to my phone, tablet, and some I even printed on paper to make sure. You wouldn't catch me off guard. I was prepared. Except for the first time I enter a car and the driver started doing the roundabout in the wrong direction, and I start freaking out thinking that I'm going to die! Yeah, England, I wasn't prepared for that.

At the office everyone was nice. On my first night, we went for dinner and a walk. They got busy catching Pokemon while I had my fun enjoying the view. The following days I made them my own and enjoyed my well-deserved alone time.

On the third day, I decided to get to know my Airbnb hosts; they were a friendly couple, both in their fifties. Surprisingly, it was one of the best conversations I had in a while. They were brilliant. And great listeners. They had accomplished so much and were planning much more; as if their life was just starting. I was inspired. They lived in many places and held multiple jobs. They had two kids who were working/traveling all around the world. We talked for hours on the following days, and they certainly made an impression on me.

When I came back to Portugal, the world was simpler. I felt like I could do anything. I got back that naive feeling from when I was younger; as if I could take over the world!

I've read about it. The wonders of traveling alone. Now I've made up my mind. Next year, I'm exploring the world by myself.

**Back to work**

This week we hosted the [Braga.JS meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bragajs/). Unfortunately, I wasn't there, but they told me it was awesome. We also had our usual Friday talks, here are some photos:
