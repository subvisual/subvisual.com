Subvisual and The New Digital School are offering a Design Sprint - [Apply now!](https://subvisual.typeform.com/to/KJonG6)

Design Sprints are a great deal for us here at [Subvisual](https://subvisual.co/). We do them when starting a project, when doing a redesign, when adding new features, and more. They are rooted in our processes now and are the base that sustains our work. 

So, what are Design Sprints?
A Desing Sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers. Developed at [Google Ventures](https://www.gv.com/), it's a “greatest hits” of business strategy, innovation, behavior science, design thinking, and more; packaged into a battle-tested process that any team can use.

Like many of the things we have in our processes now, we learned about the Design Sprints through more experienced teams, like Google Ventures, [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/playbook/product-design-sprint/introduction), and others. Our way of saying thank you is exploring the exercises, sharing results and spreading the word, as they did. This time we wanted to take it further, and that's why we will be offering two complete Design Sprints along with our friends at [The New Digital School](http://thenewdigitalschool.com/).

The New Digital School is a student-centered educational project in the area of digital design. Without teachers or assessment, the students are free to learn whatever they want while being supported by industry mentors. These creative and motivated students are eager to contribute to the success of as many projects as they can, hence our collaboration.

Here it is how this will going to work: 
1st - We are going to team up with The New Digital School to bring extra creative talent to the Design Sprint. 
2nd - Together we will offer the two Design Sprints to nonprofit organizations on an open call that starts now. We are particularly interested in the healthcare related projects. 

We will divide the students into two teams and two sprints and select two projects from all applications. The teams will be composed of a member from Subvisual, at least two members of the selected organization and at least two students from The New Digital School. 

So, if you are connected in any way to a nonprofit organization that needs to build a product, a redesign, or something that may apply to a Design Sprint, please fill [this form](https://subvisual.typeform.com/to/KJonG6) and we will reach out to you soon. If you are not connected to a nonprofit organization but you know someone who does, please let them know. Submissions will close on the 24th of March.
