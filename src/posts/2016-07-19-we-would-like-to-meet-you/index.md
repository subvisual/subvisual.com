At Subvisual we take community building very seriously as you can see by
[the](http://mirrorconf.com/) [conferences](http://rubyconf.pt/) and
[meetups](http://www.meetup.com/bragajs/) we have organized or sponsored
[throughout](http://www.meetup.com/bragarb/)
[the](https://angel.co/lean-startup-meetup-minho)
[years](https://twitter.com/rubynorte), and part of building a community is
getting to know its members.

With that in mind we've prepared a [small survey](https://subvisual.typeform.com/to/T6Hchl) to get to know you better. It
shouldn't take you more than 5 minutes to complete and it would mean the world to us.

Thanks for being part of the Subvisual community. Hopefully with your answers
we'll be able to make it even better!
