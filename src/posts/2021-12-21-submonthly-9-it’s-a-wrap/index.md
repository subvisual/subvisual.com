# Submonthly #9: It’s a wrap!

2022 is just around the corner and we’re ready to say goodbye to a great year that was 2021. In fact, this was definitely our most successful year to date, but we also know that the best is yet to come! 

This year was truly remarkable. We increased our community, met new people, welcomed new ventures and partners, went back to in-person events and had some amazing talent joining our team. 
But, how did we get here? This year was just part of a journey we’ve been building for the past ten years. At first, we were just a group of young graduates from the University of Minho, who, just like today, were passionate about technology and innovations. 
Fast-forward to now and we’re working alongside some fantastic companies from all over the universe and metaverse. Aaand, we’re only just starting.

## The rise of web 3.0

\*\*\*\*[Talent Protocol](https://www.talentprotocol.com/) is a web3 platform where talent can easily launch a token for their career, and where users can back people they believe in. At Subvisual, we’ve always empowered talent. We truly believe it’s the people who make or break a company, and, in the end, our lives as a society. We simply couldn’t miss the chance to combine forces with Talent Protocol.

[Framedrop](https://www.framedrop.co/) is making it easier for streamers to share great clips and plays with their audiences, within minutes. And we want to be part of that adventure.Their use of Machine Learning and the opportunities that technology like NFTs could bring them, is definitely something we’ll be exploring next year. 

[Sandclock](https://www.sandclock.org/) is bringing the next generation of wealth creation, through the power of cutting-edge technology and economics. We’re building it with them and it has been really great to learn with such a talented team.

We had the [PinkRoom](https://pinkroom.dev/) team joining the community. They future is still mobile so this partnership reinforces our capacities with mobile skills to make sure that we have all the skills needed to tackle broader projects.

We have been working alongside [The New Digital School](http://thenewdigitalschool.com/) (TNDS) to give it a new life and to explore all its capacities. This will allow us to expand our Universe’s scope not only when it comes to design skills, but also to attract and foster talent. Our goal is to continue growing and making a difference in people’s careers, while at the same time, creating a more inclusive tech world. 

Lastly, but certainly not least, we’ve joined forces with [Lightshift Capital](https://www.lightshift.capital/). Together, we want to build a project for future entrepreneurs, that incentivizes the creation of new projects in the web 3.0 sphere. Building new ventures has been a part of our DNA since the start so we’re very excited with what this partnership will bring us. This, alongside TNDS, allows us to improve our skills in both fronts: building ventures and fostering talent.

## A peak into the Future

We loved 2021 and can’t wait to share everything we’ve got planned for next year. We expect even more talent, more technology and even more events where we can meet fascinating new people. 
We’ve set our routes, now it’s time to se sail! One thing is for sure, we know we have the most talented community backing us, so we expect a smooth journey into 2022. 

Our main purpose remains: using technology to improve society and empower communities, so here’s (some of) what we expect to achieve next year:

We will be back in 2022 with another newsletter but for now, we’ll spend some time of our families, eat a lot of food and continue dreaming about the bright future that awaits us. 

We wish you the happiest of holidays and a great start of the New Year.
