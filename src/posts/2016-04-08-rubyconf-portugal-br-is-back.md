We’re ready to announce that the 3rd edition of RubyConf Portugal is happening on October 28-29!

Again this year, this is an event envisioned by Subvisual, although everyone is invited to help us put it together. We want to join forces and unite the community, to create the best event we possibly can.

##Where?
The conference will take place once again in the beautiful city of Braga, Portugal’s third biggest city, with an incredible history and a fantastic University. 
Braga can be described as an ancient, historic city, filled with young people, determined to make a difference. We have great tech companies here, with significant international relevance, as well as young companies and startups.

##About CFPs, Tickets, Partners, and Sponsors
We will soon be launching the Call For Proposals and start selling tickets. 
Sponsors and partners are welcome, so we’d love if you could help us spread the word. Feel free to emailing us at hello@rubyconf.pt.

We are aware of the challenge that it represents to top the last editions. Creating such an ambitious conference is far from being an easy task, but we’re confident that the Ruby community will again embrace this event and help us to create a fantastic conference.

We hope to see you all this year in Braga.
