Happy 2021, everyone! ðŸ¥³ As a new year unfolds, and with it, a new decade
arises, we want to send you our best wishes for happiness, prosperity and
health.


[Portuguese word of the year] was "saudade". A word that can not simply be
translated as missing something or someone but surely relates to what a lot of
us are feeling at the beginning of new lockdowns all over the world. We want to
soften the "saudade" that the pandemic situation has densed. We want you to
feel less isolated. So, [catch up with us, anytime, anywhere][contact]. We'll
be happy to book a call and have a friendly chat.

With the new 20s just starting, it's time to look at the future trends. More
and more we see companies turning into Fintech. Surprised that Facebook is
launching a currency? We're not. Licensing, Core and Payment Systems, Data,
Regulations, Fraud Detection and User Interfaces: the Financial industry has so
many layers that there's no wonder that eventually [every company will become a
Fintech company].


## Subvisual powered companies on Forbes Top 30

And that's part of the work we've been doing. Recently, Forbes published [the
biggest 30 Fintech companies in Portugal], where some of Subvisual powered
projects were featured. Among many other promising ventures, [Coverflex],
[Drivit] and [Utrust], have been defying the barriers of financial technology
to bring up meaningful products for people and companies across the world.
We're tremendously proud of being part of that journey to the top.

## Outsourcing can be the key

This leads to another topic. There's an ongoing discussion about benefits and
risks of outsourcing development teams to bring up your ideas to life. The
Fintech industry, however, is so dense and touches so many complex layers that
it quickly confronts us with technological challenges which frequently require
other skills, or domain-specific knowledge, and bigger teams to boost the
project delivery time. By encouraging transparency, assuring security, overall
development and UX quality we have been working with very inspiring projects,
such as [Filecoin] or [Omise].


## Endless possibilities, but here's what's hot and trendy on the Fintech world

Familiar with the terms Insurtech or [Shopatainment]? The Fintech world has been
burning red hot for a couple of years and the flames don't seem to be waning
anytime soon. We invited [Finiam]'s CEO, [JosÃ© Gomes], to drop us a blog post about
what's hot and trendy on the Fintech world. [Here's his
analysis][who-let-fintech-out] to some of the ongoing trends on this industry.


## We're also evolving

![Welcome ZÃ© Pedro! Welcome Pedro!](./welcome.png)

Last month, we said that we'd continue to expand our business operations so
that you can rely on us; well, and that's what we did: Pedro is our new
full-stack developer and ZÃ© Pedro our new Team & Talent manager!

We hired a new talent manager to help us grow the team in the right direction -
both in terms of team expansion and diversity, and also in terms of personal
growth. ZÃ© Pedro has had previous experiences in startups as well as corporate
behemoths (you can find more about him [here][josepedrocabrita]) and his
mission is to help people achieve their full potential and live a more
fulfilled life through work. You can [drop him a line][mail:zepedro] if you're
keen to know more about any of these subjects.  He's currently living in
Toulouse (France) and therefore knows well what remote work is all about.

In a world marked by VUCA - volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity -
we've often been told that the pandemic made companies [experience a degree of
change during the last year equivalent to several years] under "normal"
circumstances. Work is no exception. 

With most offices closed, many people were forced to work remotely, and that
poses new challenges. How do we keep purpose, engagement, resilience, and
relationships - the ingredients for a satisfying work life - working, when so
much has been disrupted?

![](./cooks.png)

Remote as the only alternative is very different from having a choice, and
going to the office whenever you wanted to. There was a way to quickly
replenish your levels of "work satisfaction". Not anymore. And that's [taking a
toll on us], even spilling into our personal lives.

We're all still trying to find the answers. That's one of the reasons why
mental health, in all fairness, has become a trending topic. We at Subvisual
are proud of having a culture where this is openly discussed and we think
that's the way it should be. How has Covid-19 impacted you or your
organization? What measures are you taking to face this new reality?
