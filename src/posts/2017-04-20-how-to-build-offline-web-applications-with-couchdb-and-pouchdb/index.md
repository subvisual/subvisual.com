You may have heard about [Progressive Web Apps
(PWAs)](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/).
These are web applications that leverage the new Web APIs to look and feel like
native applications. There is plenty [the web can do
today](https://whatwebcando.today/) that was only available to native
applications before: push notifications; icons on the home screen; offline
mode. PWAs are an opportunity to rethink how we build the web and learn from
native applications.

When I first started reading about offline applications, CouchDB was popping up
all the time. Offline applications are distributed systems, so we need to
take into account data reconciliation and conflict resolution. This is
when CouchDB comes into play with an out of the box solution.

This is the article that I wish I had found when I first started working with
CouchDB. It explains how CouchDB works, its limitations, and how we can use it
to build offline web applications.

## Understanding CouchDB

[CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) is a database. It sells itself with
this sentence:

_Seamless multi-master sync, that scales from Big Data to Mobile, with an
Intuitive HTTP/JSON API and designed for Reliability._

It is confusing; especially the part about _Big Data to Mobile_. And it
doesn't stop there. Allow me to add some more confusion to the mix with
a list of things that come with CouchDB that you wouldn't expect in
a database:

1. A built-in reverse proxy
2. Support for user accounts, with password hashing and multiple forms of
authentication (such as cookies, oauth or tokens).
3. Document conflict resolution.
4. A changes feed.
5. Built-in web interface.

Some will say that [CouchDB is trying to be your application
server](http://nolanlawson.com/2013/11/15/couchdb-doesnt-want-to-be-your-database-it-wants-to-be-your-web-site).
For this article, I will focus on what we can use to build offline
applications.

There is another great piece of technology that we need:
[PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com). It's a database inspired by CouchDB, that runs
in the browser and allows applications to store data locally, while offline,
and later synchronise it with CouchDB.

Quick recap: CouchDB is a database that you run on your server and has
some esoteric capabilities, such as the HTTP/JSON API. CouchDB implements
a replication protocol that allows two instances in a cluster to
synchronise both ways. PouchDB is a database that runs on the browser and
synchronises with CouchDB, like any other instance of a cluster.

In the following sections I explain how both these technologies work.

### How data is stored in CouchDB

CouchDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. An instance of CouchDB
hosts many databases. Each database can have documents. A document is
a JSON object. CouchDB provides a RESTful HTTP API to read and update
documents.

If your CouchDB instance lives in `/couchdb`, then one of your databases would
live in `/couchdb/database1`, and a document would live in
`/couchdb/database1/document_id`. There are special databases, such as `_users`
that stores CouchDB's users. There are also special documents such as
`_security` that control access to a database.

CouchDB has views for querying and reporting on documents. Views are defined by
JavaScript functions that map keys to values. We can also write reduce
functions, in JavaScript, that summarise data.

Because CouchDB speaks HTTP/JSON we can easily bypass our web server, and
make requests to it from the browser. We don't have to, but that's what
PouchDB expects us to do. When PouchDB syncs, it generates HTTP requests
that match CouchDB's API, so there's no point in transforming them.

Is this safe? A database exposed to the world doesn't sound safe at all,
but CouchDB has user accounts and permissions. When PouchDB connects to
CouchDB, it needs to send some credentials (password, token, cookie, etc),
just like with any other web application.

### Managing user accounts in CouchDB

How do we create accounts in CouchDB? We can have a web application (in
Rails or Phoenix) that has admin credentials and exposes an endpoint
that validates information and creates accounts in CouchDB. I don't
usually run CouchDB as my primary database; if I'm running Phoenix, my
primary database would probably be PostgreSQL, and Phoenix would be
responsible for creating user records in PostgreSQL and CouchDB accounts.

I had a hard time understanding how CouchDB fits in my system, so I made
  a diagram with the different interactions when registering and
  authenticating requests.

![A sequence diagram with the browser, the web application and CouchDB](https://subvisual.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/post_image/236/original.png)

The first request is made to Phoenix, sending the new user's email and
password. Phoenix will validate both and create an account, inserting
a record in PostgreSQL. After, it takes the id of the new user and sends
a request to CouchDB to create an account for that user (the id will be
his username in CouchDB). It uses the id, not the email, because it needs
a value that doesn't change. Everything up until this point should be in
a transaction to make sure there is a CouchDB database for every user.

When both databases have the user, Phoenix encrypts the user's id with
a key &mdash;that I generated and it's only known to Phoenix and CouchDB&mdash;,
and returns the resulting token to the browser. The browser then takes that
token and the user's id, and uses them to make authenticated requests to
CouchDB. Because it has the same key as Phoenix &mdash;the one that only the two
of them know&mdash;, it will validate the requests.

With this we can leverage Phoenix's authentication system to authorise
users in CouchDB. The method described here is called Proxy Authentication
and you can read more about it in [CouchDB's
documentation](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/api/server/authn.html#proxy-authentication).
There are other authentication mechanisms in CouchDB that could fit your
use case better.

### One database per user

CouchDB offers a minimal read level security: databases can have admins
and readers, there is no document level security. Because of that, if you
grant a user access to the database, he will be able to read every
document in it. Doesn't sound good does it?

This is why most applications use one database per user. If it seems
unreasonable, know [it is common to have 100k databases in a Cloudant
account](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/couchdb-user/201401.mbox/%3C52CEB873.7080404@ironicdesign.com%3E)
(Cloudant is a CouchDB provider). Databases are lightweight.

In the context of one database per user, know that PouchDB replicates a single
database, not the entire instance. Running PouchDB in your client, you need to
specify which database you want to replicate from a CouchDB instance. You can
run multiple instances of PouchDB, but everything is already prepared to use
this level of permissions.

This works great if you have an app where each user's data is fairly well
segmented. However, as soon as you want to allow a user to access another
user's data, or you want to create aggregate queries across multiple users'
data, the one-database-per-user pattern starts to break down.

There's a [plugin that automates the creation of a private database for
each user](https://github.com/etrepum/couchperuser), but with CouchDB
2 you only need to [enable it in the
  configuration](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/config/couch-peruser.html?highlight=per%20user).

### Data Replication

CouchDB is a peer-based distributed database. It allows users to read and
update the same data (shared across multiple instances) while disconnected.
CouchDB has the ability to synchronise two copies of the same database. If
there is a conflict, both revisions will be saved, and a heuristic will
determine which revision wins. Both databases will have the same winner, but
you can write your own mechanisms of conflict resolution.

### Configuring CouchDB

CouchDB has a built-in web interface called Fauxton. It can be reached at
`http://couchdb-url:5984/_utils`. Fauxton can be used for setup, configuration,
querying, and most administrative tasks.

![A screenshot of Fauxton](https://subvisual.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/post_image/233/original.png)

CouchDB can also be configured through a text file at `/etc/couchdb/local.ini`.
Take the following example of a configuration file:

```
[admins]
admin = mysecretpassword

[cors]
origins = http://localhost, https://localhost, http://couch.mydev.name:8080

[couch_peruser]
enable = true
```

In this file we create an admin, configure CORS, and enable the plugin that
ensures that a private database exist for each document in the `_users`
database.

I usually configure CouchDB through this file because it allows me to save
  it to my repository and quickly create similar instances. CouchDB
  doesn't require much configuration and everything works out-of-the-box;
  you only need to create the first admin. For our offline applications we
  may need to enable `couch_peruser`, but you have to evaluate and decide
  if you need the private database.

## Understanding PouchDB

PouchDB's official description, from the docs:

_It enables applications to store data locally while offline, then synchronize
it with CouchDB and compatible servers when the application is back online,
keeping the user's data in sync no matter where they next login._

PouchDB is a database that runs in the browser and synchronises with CouchDB.
It's not necessary to have CouchDB to use PouchDB, and you can
use it just to have a nice abstraction over
[IndexDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) and [Web
SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_SQL_Database).

I found that CouchDB + PouchDB solves a couple of use-cases well,
but becomes unpleasant to work with if you need data that is shared
between multiple users and requires different access levels.

### Getting started with PouchDB

In this article I'm not going to build a demonstration application, I'm
only going to show the code needed to get started and synchronise an
instance of PouchDB with a database in CouchDB.

We start by requiring creating a local database:

```javascript
import PouchDB from 'pouchdb-browser'

const db = new PouchDB('documents')
```

You can create a document in that database:

```javascript
db.post({ text: 'Such a beautiful day' })
```

Now that we have a local database, we create another instance of PouchDB
that uses a remote storage (CouchDB), instead of Web SQL or IndexDB.

```javascript
const remoteDatabase = new PouchDB(`http://couchdb-url/documents`)
```

Finally, we synchronise the databases both ways.

```javascript
PouchDB.sync(db, remoteDatabase, {
  live: true,
  heartbeat: false,
  timeout: false,
  retry: true
})
```

In this example I'm enabling replication in both ways and real time. I'm
also enabling retry, which will make PouchDB reconnect if the connection
goes down. It has a heuristic to choose how much time to wait between
reconnection attempts.

A common question about PouchDB is how much data can we store with
it? Chrome, Firefox and Safari are only limited by disk space. You can
read more about it in [PouchDB's
FAQ](https://pouchdb.com/faq.html#data_limits).

### Authenticating with CouchDB

If you skimmed over the previous sections, please go back and read the section
about CouchDB's user accounts because the information I present there is
important to understand the following examples.

In our previous example, we synced a local PouchDB database to a CouchDB
database, but we didn't use any form of authentication. In this section
we'll demonstrate how to sync with each user's private database. Because
we enabled a database per user, we know that our users have a private
database in CouchDB. The private database is named after the user's
username (which is the user's id in PostgreSQL) in the following format
`userdb-{hex encoded username}`.

We start by creating a database and maybe adding some documents to it:

```javascript
import PouchDB from 'pouchdb-browser'

const db = new PouchDB('documents')

db.post({ text: 'Such a beautifull day' })
```

I will now assume that you have authenticated your user, and you have
his username and CouchDB token (the ones I talked about in the section
about CouchDB's user accounts). Finally, we create a remote database sending
the username and token in the AJAX headers.

```javascript
export sync = (currentUser) => {
  const remoteDatabase = new PouchDB(`${COUCHDB_URL}/userdb-${hexEncode(currentUser.id)}`, {
    skipSetup: true,
    ajax: {
      headers: {
        'X-Auth-CouchDB-UserName': `${currentUser.id}`,
        'X-Auth-CouchDB-Roles': 'users',
        'X-Auth-CouchDB-Token': currentUser.couchdb_token,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
      }
    }
  })

  PouchDB.sync(db, remoteDatabase, {
    live: true,
    heartbeat: false,
    timeout: false,
    retry: true
  })
}
```

The databases are now in sync. But we didn't have to wait for it to start
querying the database. Once it is instantiated, we can start working with
the data we have locally; that is the selling point of offline
applications.

## Hosting and Learning Material

There are two more topics I feel obliged to address &mdash;hosting and
documentation&mdash; because it is where I think CouchDB falls short.

I use Heroku a lot. Call me lazy, but when I'm working on a small team, or
by myself, I like to know that my application is going to keep running with
little maintenance. Heroku doesn't support CouchDB, and all the CouchDB
providers I found are expensive for me. The most popular one seems to be
[Cloudant](https://cloudant.com/); you can judge for yourself. For now, I'm
running on Digital Ocean, but this isn't the ideal scenario for me.

I noticed there aren't many blog posts on CouchDB; there are a couple
of introductory blog posts to PouchDB and that's it. I also know many companies
running CouchDB + PouchDB in production, but there doesn't seem to be a big
open source application we can learn from.

This isn't my first attempt at CouchDB + PouchDB. A couple of years ago I
walked the same road and gave up. I was about to give up this time too, but to
be fair, it was my fault for not paying attention to the documentation,
because it's very thorough. CouchDB's documentation has been without
a doubt a great help.

## Final words

I would recommend CouchDB + PouchDB to anyone building offline experiences.
It does not work for every use case, but, when it does, it makes building
applications a joy. I also intend to check out the competition:
[Kinto](https://github.com/Kinto/kinto). I don't know yet how different it is
from CouchDB, but I would like to know if it shines where CouchDB falls short.
