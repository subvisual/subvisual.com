intro: "Why would a group of people as young as we were start a company? We had no relevant entrepreneurial experience, we were young and straight out of university, so we’ve come to expect that question. Part of the answer is that we couldn’t find a company that would allow us to work on the things that we were passionate about, while obsessively honing our skills. But also, and maybe even more importantly, we were friends. Talent and ambition played a part too, but that friendship became the cornerstone of everything we’ve built. Three years on, and that remains true. We are proud of these roots, humbled even."

Why would a group of people as young as we were start a company? We had no relevant entrepreneurial experience, we were young and straight out of university, so we’ve come to expect that question. Part of the answer is that we couldn’t find a company that would allow us to work on the things that we were passionate about, while obsessively honing our skills. But also, and maybe even more importantly, we were friends. Talent and ambition played a part too, but that friendship became the cornerstone of everything we’ve built. Three years on, and that remains true. We are proud of these roots, humbled even.

Throughout our time as a company, we have built on these roots, gathered a group of brilliant, passionate people that feel the same way. The pursuit of craftsmanship that we endeavoured for has given us a purpose. We are as proud of our achievements as we are eager for the long way still ahead of us.

This brings us to the present, and to the subject of this post. Contact with leads and potential partners have for a while now left us with the feeling that the name Group Buddies is failing to transmit what we are about. We talked with our clients and partners and it was unanimous: it doesn’t translate our vision for the company.

We are ruthless in our pursuit of the best product. We are bold in our dedication to the clients’ needs. We scrutinize our code to the uttermost levels of efficiency. We ascertain the users’ needs through interviews and testing sessions, and design products that are delightfully tailored to their needs. We excel at scoping the micro details, the tiny, almost invisible subtleties that deliver excellence.

We have no time for “good enough” and that sets us apart. We want that uniqueness to come to mind the minute you hear about us. We are ambitious; we want to be an international reference when it comes to building digital experiences. 

It is time for a change.

We are changing our name to **Subvisual**.

Subvisual stands for something that is too small to be visible to the naked eye and serves as a metaphor for our perfectionism and attention to the smallest details. It is a tribute to those who don’t care much about showing grandeur but rather work to become great. It reflects that we will stretch further and do so in many different, meaningful ways, such as [Creators School](http://creatorsschool.com/) or [RubyConf Portugal](http://rubyconf.pt). It's a seal of guarantee of excellent [work](https://subvisual.co/work/).

It stands for more than what we do. It’s how we do it. 

From all of us here at [Subvisual](https://subvisual.co), thank you for sticking with us. We can’t wait to show you what’s ahead of the curve.
