At Subvisual, everyday is a day to learn something new. Everyday is an intense experience. Everyday is a day for exploring a new topic, a new subject, a new idea. Therefore, and because we believe in giving back by sharing, we are announcing the return of our Summer Camp!

### Program

The Summer Camp will start on the 16th of July. You will be with us for 10 straight weeks, during which you’ll improve your skills with our mighty mentors. We are prepared to answer your most curious and intricate questions and help you master the art of craftsmanship. You will meet and talk with all kinds of technology lovers.

We want to provide a unique experience for our campers. The Camp will take place in our office, in Braga, Portugal. It’s important that you feel engaged with our energy and dynamic in a place where anything can happen.
