There's something special about organising conferences that has always been a
big part of us. A couple of years ago, we decided to stop. We decided that after
three Ruby Conf Portugal and three Mirror Conf's, we needed a break. That, of
course, didn't last long and here we are, back at it.

Ruby Conf Portugal and Mirror Conf were very special. They were homely and
communal events that reached beyond their developer and designer communities and
interacted with the world around it. It was magical for us, it was magical for
the attendees and we wanted to have that experience once again. This time we
were set on organising an Elixir conference and we [announced Alchemy
Conf][alchemy-announcement]. Unfortunately, a spiraling situation regarding
COVID-19 in Portugal forced us to go radio silence while we figured out what to
do.

The bad news: **there will be no Alchemy Conf in Portugal this year.** Your
safety is of utmost importance for us. We aren't able to host it in conscience
of putting you or your loved ones at risk. We will be back in 2022 for the most
exquisite Elixir conference in Portugal.

The good news: **[there will be a VirtuAlchemy Conf][alchemy]. A one-day virtual
version of Alchemy Conf for 2021. It will happen May 28th.**

Our whole thing with conferences lies on two pillars: networking and community.
**For us, networking is one of the biggest challenges and we're trying to devote
a lot of time thinking it through.** Networking is all about nurturing the
connections between attendees. We don't want you to miss out on it, so you can
count on several moments where you'll be able to interact closely with the
Elixir community, if you want to.

However, we want to nurture the community that surrounds us as well. **All of
the proceedings of the conference will be split between two institutions: [Virar
A Página][vap] and [From Kibera With Love][fkwl]**. We will be setting a ticket
price of 25€, however **you are free to donate any amount on top of that.** We
will make sure it gets equally split among both institutions. They're already
flying so make sure you [grab your ticket][tickets]!

We also wanted to try our best to do a **carbon-free conference: we are
partnering with our friends from [Tree This][tree-this] to plant a tree for
every attendee that takes part in the conference.**

**The virtual conference will start at 9:00 GMT and unofficially end at 18:30
GMT.** If you want to hang around afterwards we will be organising some casual
moments for you to chill.

**What you can expect:** a broad range of speakers, lots of fun moments, a
laidback environment and the chance to speak at the conference. **We will be
opening CFP soon.** Everyone is free to apply.

**In the meantime we will be posting all updates [via
Twitter][alchemy-twitter]**, so you stay up to date regarding all speaker
announcements, CFP news and more. All of the info will be [in our
website][alchemy] as well.

We are all very excited about what's coming and we can't wait to see you at the
conference. Help us get the community together. Help us make this memorable and
magic.

Forever yours,

The Alchemy Conf Team
