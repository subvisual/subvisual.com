  How important is the community for you? It's been four years since our last
  conference. And now we're back.

How important is the community for you? I get asked this sometimes and
inevitably end up reminiscing about Subvisual’s origins. At the time, there
wasn’t a Subvisual, if I’m honest. No, that was still a few years down the road.
There was a Group Buddies, however. A small Ruby and Rails consultancy firm. We
were still taking our first steps and barely made by. This was in 2012, a year
that, in retrospect, defined us. We were presented with the opportunity to
support a small Ruby conference called Ruby Norte and decided to bite the
bullet. Sponsorship was "only” 250€. The use of quotes is not an exaggeration
since, at the time, when we stared at our bank account statement, we saw 200€
staring back at us. The remaining 50€ were put out of our own pockets. I can
never give a correct answer to the question of "how important the community is,”
but **I can look back and proudly say it has always been a part of us.**

A lot more followed. **We started organizing several meetups** (Braga.rb,
Braga.js, Braga.Design, Braga.Product, Braga BEAM), **helped others by hosting
them in our office, eventually went around to organize [Ruby Conf
Portugal][rubyconf] from 2014 to 2016. From 2016 to 2018, we also had [Mirror
Conf][mirrorconf]**, a conference that aimed to become a conversation between
designers and front-end developers. Doing this for years on end took its toll,
of course, and we needed a break.

We have evolved from working mainly as a Ruby on Rails consultancy firm to a
venture studio during the past few years, where we help create new startups.
With this transition, we found Elixir to be a valuable alternative that we
should invest in, and we’ve been working with it for more than four years. Many of
us have been speakers at conferences, written blog posts, talked in podcasts and
screencasts, etc. **We still look to inspire those around us, and we can sense a
real vibrancy in the booming Elixir community in Portugal.** It feels like 2014
again, with the Ruby community. **It’s contagious, inspiring, and it urges us to
jump into action.** That’s why we’re back organizing conferences. Big time.

## What it is

**Alchemy Conf will be a two-day Elixir conference held in the lovely city of
Braga, Portugal.** Braga is Portugal’s third-largest city. It’s beautiful,
history-rich, with a fantastic university, filled with young potential. We have
a booming tech ecosystem here, encompassing fully fledged international
companies and promising startups.

**The conference will take place on the 14th and 15th of May 2021. It will be a
single-track conference, with a mixture of guest speakers and CFP selections.**
The first speaker announcements are just right around the corner, and the CFPs
will open soon.

**[The early birds are on sale now][tickets].** We are looking into student
discounts, so if you are a student, send us an email to [hello@alchemyconf.com].

Like the previous conferences we organized, Alchemy Conf is community-driven.
This means it is a non-profit. Our focus is and always has been to inspire the
community. To create an opportunity for developers and enthusiasts to get
together, to share and learn, experience, and network. From the attendees to the
speakers, we want everybody to feel like Alchemy Conf is a little bit of their
own. This is why we want to fully commit to transparency. **We will be making a
transparency report containing the expenses and earnings of the conference. Any
profit that may arise will be given back to the community.**

## The Road to Alchemy Conf

Even though we’re almost seven months away from the start of the conference, we
want everyone to feel like they are a part of it. We want the road to Alchemy
Conf to be a journey. And **we want to bring the community closer during times of
hardship, even though we can’t all be physically together yet.**

We will be setting up **three online workshops in the months leading up to the
conference, all of them around Elixir development, to be given by leading
developers in the community. Each workshop will have a cost of 50€. Taking part
in all three will earn you a free ticket to the conference.** We’re aiming to
encourage and reward taking part in community events. That’s why the total cost
of the lot, 150€, is the same as an early bird ticket - there won't be any
difference in terms of total cost for the participants.

The Road to Alchemy will be filled with surprises and will culminate with **a
Braga BEAM meetup + welcome drinks on the 13th of May 2021. This meetup will be
free to attend and open to everyone, even if you’re not taking part in the
conference.**

## Sponsorship

**We are currently open to sponsorships.** We’re working on making a prospectus with
attractive options, but in the meantime feel free to reach out to
[sponsorships@alchemyconf.com].

## COVID

We know these are times of uncertainty and insecurity, especially when deciding
how and if we should attend an event. Hopefully, things will be picking up come
May. Either way, we will be working with the health authorities to make sure
every precaution is taken before and during the event. Your safety is of upmost
importance. **The conference is for the attendees and if we cannot ensure their
safety, we will contact in a timely manner and trade the ticket for a postponed
event or refund it fully.**

Meanwhile, follow the [conference Twitter account][twitter] and [the
website][website]. There are a few surprises lined up, you don’t want to miss!

We’ll be waiting to see you in Braga!
