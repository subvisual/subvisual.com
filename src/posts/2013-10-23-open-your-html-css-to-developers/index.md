Have you ever showed your HTML/CSS to a Developer?

No?

Well if that’s the case, let me tell you that you’re losing precious insight and along with that, the chance of becoming a better designer and writing better code.

I’m a web designer, so I understand why you’d be skeptical about this. Designers and Developers seem to live in different worlds most of the time. I know how hard it is to make sense of what they say, but we should be humble enough to admit that they deal with chaos and havoc daily and still manage to keep an orderly, objective way to look at things. They’re disciplined, organized and they make things work.

At least the great ones.

As Designers, we pride ourselves on being obsessed with pixel-perfect design, but when it comes to coding those pixels, those guys kick our ass. 

You can put your heart and soul into your code, really try to make that CSS look *sexy* and feel like you’re the King of the World for landing that perfect gradient, but rest assured my friend:

It’s not perfect.

It can be better. Seriously.

Here, at GB, we do **code reviews**. 
We encourage everyone to look at the code and give feedback and suggestions.
If you have any doubts whatsoever, if you can’t picture a way of making that simple, elegant, beautiful piece of code better, just ask a developer to take a look at it.


Make sure you ask a great one.
He’ll probably crush your ego and step on your toes but I guarantee that he’ll make it better.

**The whole process will make you better**.

A team where developers and designers are able to achieve a common ground in terms of goals and language, is product development nirvana.

So be brave my brothers. Share your code and hang tight.
