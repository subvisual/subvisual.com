  Last Friday we premiered the first edition of the Subvisual Live Talks, a live
  stream with a very simple concept: a conversation with interesting guests.
  The first stream features an hour of exciting conversation between our own
  host, Zamith and thoughtbot's Boston Managing Director Josh Clayton. There's
  more to come.

We just had our first [Subvisual Live Talk](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/594487926). Besides our usual [podcast](https://podcast.subvisual.com/), we wanted to try the concept of sharing some of our talks for a while now. Then Zamith took charge. Last Friday we premiered the first edition of a live stream with a very simple concept: **a conversation with interesting guests**. For us, simplicity is key.

The first stream features **an hour of exciting conversation between our own host, [Zamith](https://twitter.com/zamith) and [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot)'s Boston Managing Director [Josh Clayton](https://twitter.com/joshuaclayton).**

Zamith and Josh dive into the **nature of consulting work, building digital products, the essence of several programming languages, open source and many other topics**. You can ask questions via the chat or by tweeting with the hashtag [#subvisualtalks](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23subvisualtalks&src=typed_query). If you missed it, we made the [full-length VOD of the stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/594487926) available for everyone out there.

## What's next

We're aiming to make this a weekly occurence and already have a string of guests lined up. If you have any suggestions, feel free to tweet at us.

That being said, **we're going to be back this Thursday, April 23 at 6 P.M. WEST (GMT+1)** with a very special guest: **[Saša Jurić](https://twitter.com/sasajuric)**, renowed alchemist and author of [Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-second-edition?a_aid=sjuric)!
