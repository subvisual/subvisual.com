  A year on after the lockdown here's our lessons learned on working remotely.

We've been remote-friendly since the beginning of the company but, until 2020,
we've never had the full team remote. 

The pandemics changed our lives drastically and pushed us too to work from home
as the lockdown all over the world took place. It was scary, we had a lot of
questions about how things would work and most of the time we felt like we were
missing so much from not being together in the same space. But, with this
newsletter, we want to celebrate this last year and compile what we've learned
so far. 

Month after month, we started to become a little more comfortable with this new
reality, despite missing being together and our constant sharing ideas about
our next retreat (that somewhat has been comforting us).

Being a people-centric company, we iterated on our WFH model having our team's
feedback and culture on the center.

> We care about people, we try to understand their needs, we learn constantly
> and we give back by sharing.

People are at the center of everything we do, so we started by actively listen
to everyone, trying to understand their needs, feelings, and context. Did they
had kids at home to take care of? Were they sharing a space with someone else?
Did they had an ergonomic setup? Did they live alone (the isolation feeling
could be higher for them)?... We started by creating this map of the context of
our team members so we could create a more personalized approach. 

We also tried to keep a positive approach. Besides, as part of who we are, we
embrace change as a constant and we never assume to know everything. So the
priority during the first weeks of the lockdown was basically to look at this
as a new challenge and an opportunity to learn together.

Once we started to understand how our team was tackling the WFH experience, we
started reviewing the foundations of what we defined as a remote-friendly
culture:

- **Decentralized communication & Transparency** - keep information accessible
  to everyone.
- **Asynchronous work** - remember that very few things need to be done in a
  minute.
- **Empathy Is Everything** - always assume positive intent. Tone and nuance
  can get lost over chat, so assuming your colleague is coming from a positive
  place helps with any potential misunderstandings.
- **Expect Structure & Rules** - establish processes, structure,
  responsibility, and rules.


## Decentralized communication, Transparency & Asynchronous work

To ensure everyone is aligned and has access to the information is a constant
concern. But having everyone WFH during this last year forced us to **define
how, where, why, and when we communicate**.

The first tools we started to use on a more regular basis were collaborative
tools like [Miro] and [Milanote]. We were big fans of post-its and whiteboards
during work sessions, we believe we have to give some individual time for
brainstorming/feedback moments before starting a discussion. So these kinds of
tools helped us recreate the experience of working in the same room and having
a shared whiteboard where anyone can share their thoughts.

We also started to make better use of [Basecamp] for important discussions. We
use [Slack] to share resources, to schedule meetings, to send reminders, to
have small discussions, and to have fun at work. But when we want to discuss
meaningful topics asynchronously we use Basecamp. We never expect or require to
get an answer immediately (unless it's a true emergency), even on Slack, but
basecamp helps us to organize the topics and to give the amount of time these
meaningful discussions need.

And we also started to use [Notion] since we felt our documentation was lost
between G Drive and Basecamp. So we now have our Handbook, Knowledge base,
Processes and Guidelines in the same place. It's our way to ensure our
information is organized and easily accessible to anyone.

We use a lot of other tools but those are the ones that really improved our
internal communication. **And the key learning point about tools and
communication is to first seek to understand your needs. Don't try to use a
tool just because it seems cool, use it because it will solve a communication
problem you and your team are experiencing.**

The second key learning point we want to share is that: **Asynchronous
communication is superior in almost every case**. With everyone experiencing
cyclical lockdowns, the disruption affects more than people's work life. This
means that not only we don't see each other physically anymore, but more often
than not our working hours do not overlap. So, the ability to discuss projects
and other matters became even more important. We rely heavily on Basecamp to
discuss ongoing projects and tasks - where one can participate on their own
time - and we use Slack for quick interactions (even if async). Needless to
say, when working async you cannot assume anything - to make it work, you need
to “spill the beans” and explain things as if you're talking to someone who
just landed on planet earth. Communication is even more important, and brings
us to the next point: **Over-communication always beats under-communication**.


## Empathy Is Everything

Since lockdowns' early days, we tried to reduce the psychological distance
between each other. As we wrote on the introduction, caring, and understanding,
are two of our core values. Therefore, we immediately set ourselves up to
create virtual events that mitigated the physical distance that was imposed
upon us. In the beginning, we tried to replicate what we had at the office; but
in time, we found this approach to be flawed because our dynamics had
fundamentally changed. **This was a big learning for us: replicating what works
at the office won't work when everyone is working remotely. Focus on creating
new experiences.** Hence, we adapted and created new moments for sharing
(work-related but also social moments) **that took into account the new WFH
dynamic**. In our cooking challenge Slack channel, we share our recipes and
photos of our cooking skills absolutely async. No need to do this in real-time.
We created the good, the bad, and the ugly, where we previously fill in a few
cards of what went well and not so well during last quarter (async) and discuss
this in an online call (sync) with a few beers. These are just two examples.
**Another key learning is to keep your ears open to your team's feedback and
iterate whenever needed.** Let them tell you what they like, don't like, and
want more of. Just listen. 

On an internal level, make sure you're connected and you communicate openly -
as said before, default on the excess of communication, and not the opposite -
and assure that you leave room for a healthy work-life balance. It's easy to
overwork; **if needed, push for people to take time off and go on vacations.**
Ensure absolute disconnection. For many of us these concepts were obvious
before last year, but not anymore. Reflect and be conscious of them, pay
attention, and ensure you're resting properly - both mentally and physically.  

Last but not least, if you're a manager with direct reports, an HR responsible,
or someone who's in charge of other people, invest in a cross-team or even
cross-company **mental health program**. This should serve two purposes: first,
each individual should be aware of how he/she is dealing with the current
situation (isolation, many hours in front of the pc, harder to practice sports,
these are some example challenges); and second, the program should also provide
low-effort, easy-access, qualified resources to help dealing with a potentially
dangerous situation. 


## Expect Structure & Rules

The lack of a routine and [healthy habits] can lead you to a more stressful life,
poor sleep quality, and, consequently, less productivity and ineffective use of
your time.

With the pandemic, we had to not only start to work remotely but we were forced
to work at home. And there's a big difference between the two of them. Working
remote means you can work from any place you want, WFH means you have to do it
at home and (for the majority of us) without the ideal conditions.

There's a lot of traps of WFH, the ones we felt like the most impactful on our
daily life were not knowing when to stop working, dealing with all the non-work
related distractions, and the ergonomic of our new and improvised workstation.

So, here's **Subvisual's lessons learned for WFH**:

- Set a schedule and be flexible about it, because unforeseen events will
  happen. And do not overwork, learn when to quit; 
- Get the right equipment. At Subvisual anyone could take material from the
  office and we also offer a budget so anyone could have a proper space to
  work;
- Try to separate the office from the rest of the home;
- Don't forget to socialize and call your family and friends;
- Take real breaks during the day;
- Go out for a walk every day (and enjoy the sunny days, your body and mind
  will thank you ☀️).
