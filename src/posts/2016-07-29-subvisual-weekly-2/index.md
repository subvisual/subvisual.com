intro: "Last night I left home to have a drink with a friend. Next thing I know I'm at the office's door. This has been happening a lot. My mind wanders into the future, and my body goes into auto-pilot. Sometimes the mind wanders so deeply that you forget what you were up to in the first place."

Last night I left home to have a drink with a friend. Next thing I know I'm at the office's door. This has been happening a lot. My mind wanders into the future, and my body goes into auto-pilot. Sometimes the mind wanders so deeply that you forget what you were up to in the first place.

I've been thinking about the future of Subvisual. We started about four years ago when everyone was fresh out of college. Now, we are moving into a new office, designed and built uniquely for us. The kind of office that you see on [Office Snapshots][officesnapshots]. An office we wouldn't dare to dream of two years ago. 

On top of that, we are also opening an office in Boston, with the idea to replicate what we did here in Braga. We will travel there regularly, hire talented, amazing people, and become part of the community. I still can't believe we have come this far.

When I think about it, I feel a big relief and a bigger responsibility. I'm very proud of what we've accomplished, but the bar is so high now. I keep thinking if we are good enough. If we deserve this success. There are a lot more experienced companies out there. Most of them are an inspiration to us. They are giants and we just started. Sometimes it feels we're a bit out of our league. But maybe things have changed. We worked hard, and we have accomplished so much. Maybe we're not small anymore. Maybe we have stepped up our game and proved ourselves. Hopefully, we even inspired others to do the same. 

We are not special. We are just a hard-working team. And you can do it too.

**Back to work**

Here is a photo of us talking with [Zamith](https://twitter.com/zamith). He's in Boston finalizing our arrangements. [Bruno](https://twitter.com/azevedo_252) will join him soon.

Last but not least, the usual, interesting content that we gather from all over the internet.

**[Design Is Mainly About Empathy][design-empathy]**

This blog post explains the concepts presented by Alan Cooper in his book "About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design". It stands behind the idea that the closest design can get to the users' mental model, the better the user will understand and anticipate it.

**[Google introduces Bubble Zoom preview for an easier comic book reading experience in Play Books][bubble-zoom]**

Reading comics on a phone is not a good experience. You see each page section by section. But comics were designed for you to enjoy full pages. This app allows you to see the full page and click to zoom the text bubbles so that you can read. I'm actually more of a Manga fan #onepiece, but I'm in love with Sandman.

**[The Churn][churn]**

Uncle Bob always has some interesting insights. In this blog post he makes another monolog, this time about the false sense of progress in programming.
