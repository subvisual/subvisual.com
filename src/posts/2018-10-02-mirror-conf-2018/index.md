We’re happy to announce that the 3rd edition of Mirror Conf is happening in 17 days! \o/

That’s October 18th and 19th, if you don’t care about date math. :)

If you’ve never heard of Mirror Conf, it is a conference that aims to blur the differences and point towards a collaborative future between designers and front-end developers.
Our goal is to gather talented designers and front-end developers from all over the globe in one event, bridging these two worlds and engaging them to share their experiences and their stories.

This year our theme is “The Future of the Web”, and we’re inviting you to a trip through time, from humanity’s first forms of art and culture to the unknown wonders the future might hold. For “to know your future you must first know your past” (to quote George Santayana).

So, if you’re a designer, a front-end developer, or any kind of person with an interest in design and making awesome stuff for the Web, this is an event we’re sure you will love.

## Location

This year the conference will take place once again in the beautiful city of Braga, Portugal’s third biggest city, with an incredible history and a fantastic University.

The conference itself will be hosted at [Forum Braga](https://www.forumbraga.com/) ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/Evs2LV3pWh82)), a brilliant renovated venue located in the heart of the city, designed for people and built to be modern, interactive, and environmentally sustainable. With one of the largest auditorium’s of the country, this will be the home of the biggest Mirror Conf yet.
