intro: "I can tell that something's off. Boxes are laying around on the floor, unorganized. People show up at our door asking us to taste food. Phones are ringing all day. And everyone is tense. Everyone but Laura; she's just pulling her hair off."

I can tell that something's off. Boxes are laying around on the floor, unorganized. People show up at our door asking us to taste food. Phones are ringing all day. And everyone is tense. Everyone but Laura; she's just pulling her hair off.

The first edition of [MirrorConf](http://mirrorconf.com/) is closing in, and everyone's busy with the preparations. I just realized that we never wrote about organizing conferences. I'll try to have someone write about it in the following weeks.

This week we all need some extra motivation, so I want to remember why we organize conferences, and how much we enjoy it. The following is a video from last year's [RubyConf Portugal](http://rubyconf.pt/), and the best moments from the staff.

Last but not least, the usual, interesting content that we gather from all over the internet.
