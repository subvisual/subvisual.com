# 8 Habits To Help You Through The Pandemic Times

Your brain is constantly building new neural pathways and, if you're staying at
home, this can be the perfect opportunity to start breaking bad habits and
replacing them with some good ones.

To help you define what good habits you could be creating during this time at
home, here's a list of the ones I consider essential.


## Habit 1 - Make your bed every morning

Making our bed in the morning might seem like something small and not really
important. But “it will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage
you to do another task and another and another.”

## Habit 2 - Drink plenty of water

You already know this but it's important so here's a friendly reminder. Keeping
hydrated is crucial for your health and well-being.

And an extra tip: if you're tired of buying water every time you go to the
supermarket, buy a water filter and get it straight from the tap. 😊


## Habit 3 - Get more sunlight

Our body creates vitamin D from direct sunlight on our skin. So, make sure you
enjoy the sunny days and, during pauses, open a window to get fresh air and
sunlight. This will improve your energy and sleep quality.


## Habit 4 - Get quality sleep

Start by avoiding screens before bedtime, defining a routine, and being
consistent with your bedtime. And if you want more tips about this, we
recommend reading this book: [Sleep Smarter by Shawn Stevenson].


## Habit 5 - Don't skip meals

Skipping meals may mean you're missing out on essential nutrients and that will
lead you to feel tired. So plan your meals, try new recipes, and keep a
balanced diet (between healthy and goodness that makes your belly happy). 🤪

## Habit 6 - Stay connected

Keeping the distance from someone you love can be difficult. But we have
technology nowadays that allows us to virtually stay in touch with friends and
family. So don't wait anymore and call someone!


## Habit 7 - Keep mentally & physically healthy

Ensure you have a routine to take care of our mind and body. You can do it
through mindfulness practices like meditation and yoga. The most important:
keep consistency.


## Habit 8 - Learn something new

Last but not least, strive to learn every day and if you're not sure about why
this habit is so important, check Ken Jennings' TED talk.

> unquenchable curiosity for the world around us.

If I caught your interest, check this [blog post][habit-guide] where James
Clear shows that it's not that hard to create new habits. The secret is to
start with one small habit, increase it in small ways, and keep consistency.

I love the concept of neuroplasticity and the idea that we can, with some work,
build new neural pathways in our brains and improve the way it works is really
exciting to me.

If you're interested in learning more about how you can create good habits and
eliminate bad ones, I recommend you start with James Clear's book: [Atomic
Habits]. It's, without a doubt, one of the best books I read this year and it
truly made me think about my routine.
