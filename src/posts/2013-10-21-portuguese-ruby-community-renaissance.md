Last Friday, me and some folks from the [Minho Ruby Brigade](https://www.meetup.com/Minho-rb/) went to the very first [Coimbra.rb](https://www.meetup.com/Coimbra-rb/) meetup. 

It was a great event with lots of _Rubyists_ sharing their enthusiasm for the language. This popped a question on my mind: is the Portuguese Ruby Community entering it's _renaissance_?

Almost a year has gone by since Zamith and I created the Minho.rb meetup. At that time we felt the need to discuss what was happening in the Ruby world, as well as revamping the northern Ruby community. 

Since [Rubynorte](https://rubynorte.heroku.com/), there were no events related to the topic. Sure there were some random meetups, but nothing recurrent, with a community behind it.

A few months later, [Porto.rb](https://www.meetup.com/porto-rb/) was created, and now there's also Coimbra.rb. And if you go even more to the south, to Lisbon, there's also [Ruby LX](https://www.meetup.com/ruby-lx), which precedes Minho.rb.

Looking back, we can see that Ruby, after it's own _renaissance_ with the creation of Ruby on Rails, has been a notorious presence in the Portuguese tech scene. We have communities dating back to 2006 such as [Ruby.PT](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ruby-pt), or even less active groups as [Ruby on Rails Portugal](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ruby-on-rails_pt/3jwMG3StNNM).

I truly believe that Ruby is becoming a well established language in Portugal, that needs even more talented and skilled people joining the community, which I hope this _renaissance_ of meetups and tech events will help to achieve.

**As a Minho.rb founder, I can assure you we'll double down our efforts in order to augment and improve the community, both in size and overall quality.**

We'll do this by creating bigger and better meetups and events, as well as contributing as much as possible with code, presentations, books or even blog posts like this.

**And to kick it off, we're thinking about organising a conference in 2014.**

What do you guys think of that?
